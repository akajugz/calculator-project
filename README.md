# calculator-project
Welcome to my Calculator Project.

In this project we have to create a Calculator using our knowledge in HTML, SCSS and JS/TS to do basic to advanced calculations using our online calculator.

There is a creteria that we are working with and it is listed below:
1. A deployed website (using GitHub Pages)
2. A public GitHub repository for your codebase
- A README.md with a short intro to the project
- At least 15 Git commits for the different stages in your development
3. Be responsive and built mobile-first, it should work on different screen widths
4. Accept a minimum of 2 inputs, perform an operation and show the output
5. DOES NOT USE THE eval() method (as this is extremely dangerous)
6. Code is highly readable (good naming and indented correctly)

Once the calculator is finished, we have to deploy the site and present it in front of our teachers and piers.
